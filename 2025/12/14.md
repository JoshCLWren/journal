Work Summary: ~7 hours, ~1200 lines - Major eBay description generation system with database integration, rate limiting, rich TUI interface; mobile-first glassmorphism UI with image sorting

## Summary
Major development day focused on eBay description generation in comics_backend and UI improvements in ebay_assistant.

## Repositories Worked On
- `~/code/comics_backend` (14 commits)
- `~/code/ebay_assistant` (3 commits)

## Comics Backend
**Logging & Quality**
- Fix names of files

- Fix series ordering and add cache versioning
- Add has_images filter to series endpoint

**eBay Description Generation - Complete Overhaul**
- Add eBay description generation script with skip logic
- Improve eBay description generation with retry logic, rate limiting, and clean progress bars
- Improve eBay description generator TUI output
- Use Rich Live TUI for eBay description generation
- Show per-model average response time in TUI
- Add descriptions
- Refactor generate_ebay_descriptions.py for performance
- Fix: change 'review' terminology to 'description' in eBay script

**Database Migration & API**
- Complete Phase 5: Migrate all eBay description scripts to database backend
- Complete Phase 6: Add integration tests, performance benchmarks, and update docs for database-first approach
- Add FastAPI endpoint for regenerating eBay descriptions

## eBay Assistant
**UI Enhancements**
