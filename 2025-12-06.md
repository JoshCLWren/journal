## Projects Legend

### comics_backend
FastAPI-based backend service for managing a comic book library database. Includes CLZ inventory integration, image management, eBay description generation using Ollama/LLMs, RESTful API endpoints, database migrations with Alembic, comprehensive test coverage, and CI/CD pipeline with Debian containers.

### ebay_assistant
React-based frontend application for eBay listing management. Features dark mode UI, image sorting, mobile-first glassmorphism design, series filtering, and integration with the comics_backend API for AI-powered eBay description generation.

### cdisplayagain
Python/Tkinter-based comic book reader application focused on performance. Uses pyvips for image processing, implements threading architecture, smart preloading, parallel decoding, supports CBR/CBZ/TAR archives, and achieves 96% test coverage. Cross-platform support with macOS compatibility.

### comic-web-scrapers
Multi-source comic price scraping and ML-powered classification system. Supports Atomic Avenue, Comic Collector Live, HipComic, MyComicShop. Includes FastAPI web UI, PostgreSQL integration, Redis caching, machine learning labeling, data importers, and deterministic comic matching algorithms.

### hipcomicscraper
Specialized scraper for HipComic.com with async/await architecture. Features page pooling, retry logic, issue number extraction, HTML export, image fetching, seller filtering, shipping analysis, and database integration with CLI tools.

### pyvips
Python bindings for libvips (image processing library). Josh contributed comprehensive type hints for version 3.2.0, including hand-written bindings, operator overloads, and expanded mypy type checking across example scripts.

### vpn-torrent
Dockerized private BitTorrent setup with VPN integration. Features AirDC++ integration, VPN watchdog service for connection stability, generalized monitoring, and persistence fixes. Designed for secure file sharing.

### comic-pile
Complex task/queue management system with 3D dice rolling interface. Features narrative session summaries, staleness awareness tracking, worktree workflow guidance, task database system, manager agent coordination, pending thread tracking, and comprehensive rating forms with issues read adjustment.

### python-starter-template
Generic Python 3.13 project template with modern tooling. Includes comprehensive README, CI/CD pipeline, ruff linting, mypy type checking, pytest testing, pre-commit hooks, and Makefile-based development targets. Created by extracting reusable patterns from cdisplayagain.
