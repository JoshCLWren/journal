**Work Summary:** ~2.5 hours, ~869 lines - Auto-generated by journal automation

## Summary
Moderate development day focused on comic-web-scrapers with 12 commits, implementing test file reorganization, falsy TTL caching for empty search results, and multiple bug fixes including session cleanup and SQL query corrections. Completed session time-scoping bug fixes and linting improvements in comic-pile as secondary priority. Primary emphasis on bug resolution, code quality improvements, and infrastructure cleanup across both projects.

## Repositories Worked On

- `~/code/comic-pile` (3 commits)
- `~/code/comic-web-scrapers` (12 commits)

- **Total: 15 commits**

## comic-pile

**Session Time-Scoping**
- Merge TASK-113: Fix session time-scoping bug
- Fix: add 6-hour time filter to get_or_create()

**Code Quality**
- Fix: enable linting in git worktrees by detecting and using main repo venv

## comic-web-scrapers

**Code Quality & Bug Fixes**
- Fix all linting and type errors in __main__.py
- Fix HipScraper cleanup() method: remove nonexistent listing_names.flush()
- Fix NoneType error in balanced_cli.py source handling
- Fix SQL query: remove non-existent vendor.description column
- fix: remove unused timeout variable and break long f-string in cli.py
- fix: add null checks for .lower() calls and safe dictionary access
- Remove CCL deprecation recommendation

**Progress Tracking & UX**
- Stop tqdm ETA timer when source reaches 100% completion
- Add completion rate metric to tqdm progress bars

**Performance Enhancements**
- Feat: Add dynamic resource allocation for remaining sources
- Implement falsy TTL caching for empty search results

**Test Organization**
- Fix Issue #6: Move test files from root to tests/ directory

## Summary of Activity

1. Resolved Issue #6 by moving test files from root to tests/ directory, improving project organization and maintaining clean repository structure
2. Implemented falsy TTL caching for empty search results to optimize performance and prevent redundant queries for known-empty results
3. Fixed multiple critical bugs including HipScraper cleanup errors, NoneType handling in CLI source processing, and invalid SQL query columns that were causing runtime failures
4. Enhanced progress tracking infrastructure with completion rate metrics and intelligent ETA timer management when sources reach 100% completion
5. Resolved all linting and type errors in __main__.py main module with comprehensive null safety checks for string operations and dictionary access patterns
6. Implemented dynamic resource allocation to optimize performance for remaining processing sources during execution cycles
7. Fixed session time-scoping bug in comic-pile's get_or_create() method with 6-hour time filter to prevent data inconsistencies across sessions
8. Cleaned up deprecated CCL recommendations and removed unused timeout variables to maintain code quality standards across the codebase
