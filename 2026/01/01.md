**Work Summary:** ~2.4 hours, ~886 lines - Auto-generated by journal automation

## Summary
Moderate development day focused on the comic repositories, primarily on comic-web-scrapers with 13 commits implementing logging, test organization, caching, and bug fixes. Key accomplishments included replacing print statements with proper logging, moving test files to the tests/ directory, and fixing session time-scoping and SQL query issues. Work balanced technical improvements with quality assurance across both codebases.

## Repositories Worked On

- `~/code/comic-pile` (4 commits)
- `~/code/comic-web-scrapers` (13 commits)

- **Total: 17 commits**

## comic-pile

**Session Management**
- Merge TASK-113: Fix session time-scoping bug
- fix: add 6-hour time filter to get_or_create()

**Development Tooling**
- fix: enable linting in git worktrees by detecting and using main repo venv

**Bug Fixes**
- fix: correct d10 die shape from cylinder to decahedron

## comic-web-scrapers

**Logging and Code Quality**
- Replace all print() statements with proper logging
- Fix all linting and type errors in __main__.py
- fix: remove unused timeout variable and break long f-string in cli.py

**Testing Organization**
- Fix Issue #6: Move test files from root to tests/ directory

**Caching**
- Implement falsy TTL caching for empty search results

**Bug Fixes**
- Fix HipScraper cleanup() method: remove nonexistent listing_names.flush()
- Fix NoneType error in balanced_cli.py source handling
- Fix SQL query: remove non-existent vendor.description column
- fix: add null checks for .lower() calls and safe dictionary access

**Progress Monitoring and Resource Management**
- Stop tqdm ETA timer when source reaches 100% completion
- Add dynamic resource allocation for remaining sources
- Add completion rate metric to tqdm progress bars

**Code Cleanup**
- Remove CCL deprecation recommendation

## Summary of Activity

1. Implemented comprehensive logging infrastructure across comic-web-scrapers, replacing all print statements with proper logging for better observability
2. Fixed critical session time-scoping bug (TASK-113) in comic-pile by adding 6-hour time filter to get_or_create() operations
3. Reorganized test structure by resolving Issue #6, moving test files from root directory to dedicated tests/ directory
4. Enhanced scraping performance and reliability with falsy TTL caching for empty search results and dynamic resource allocation
5. Resolved multiple data integrity issues including SQL query fixes, NoneType error handling, null checks, and HipScraper cleanup corrections
6. Improved progress monitoring capabilities with completion rate metrics, ETA timer controls, and enhanced user feedback via tqdm
7. Addressed code quality by fixing all linting and type errors, enabling git worktree linting support, and removing deprecation warnings
8. Fixed rendering issues including d10 die shape correction from cylinder to decahedron in comic-pile
