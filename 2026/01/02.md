## comic-pile

**Automation & Worker Pool Management**
- Feat: Add worker pool manager for fully unsupervised session
- Feat: Add manager daemon and auto-merge workflow
- Feat: Auto-unblock confused agent tasks
- Fix: Correct architecture - Worker Pool Manager is opencode agent, not Python script
- Fix: Support absolute worktree paths and add db export script
- Docs: Add Manager-5 unsupervised session prompt
- Docs: Add Worker Pool Manager prompt for opencode agent
- Docs: Add continuous operation loop and retro
- Docs: Add retro and update prompt with lessons learned

**Task Management Features**
- Feat: Add reroll functionality
- Feat: Add manual dice control
- Feat: Improve session events display
- Feat: Redesign queue screen to show all comics clearly
- Feat: Create SQLite to PostgreSQL migration script
- Fix: Preserve in_review status when unclaiming tasks
- Remove InitializeTasksResponse schema - no longer needed after removing /initialize endpoint
- Remove TASK_DATA dict and /initialize endpoint - tasks now added via API

**Bug Fixes**
- Fix: Die Rolled Display Bug
- Fix: Persist die rolled value when switching between roll and rate views
- Fix: Session Timezone Bug - Naive vs Aware Datetime Comparison
- Fix: Session timezone bug - handle naive/aware datetime comparisons
- Fix: Incorrect die step messaging at d4/d20 boundaries
- Fix: Manager review - simplify to use naive datetimes consistently

## Summary of Activity

1. Launched comprehensive automation infrastructure with worker pool manager and manager daemon for fully unsupervised agent sessions
2. Implemented auto-merge workflow and auto-unblock capabilities to reduce manual intervention in task processing
3. Delivered task management enhancements including reroll functionality, manual dice control, and redesigned queue screen
4. Resolved critical timezone handling bug affecting session datetime comparisons and fixed die display issues at d4/d20 boundaries
5. Created SQLite to PostgreSQL migration script for improved database portability
6. Improved task state management by preserving in_review status when unclaiming tasks
7. Added worker agent workflow tests and updated documentation with retro analysis from previous sessions
8. Simplified task initialization by removing hardcoded TASK_DATA and /initialize endpoint in favor of API-based task creation
