**Work Summary:** ~33.0 hours, ~9,531 lines - Auto-generated by journal automation

## Summary
Heavy development day focused on automation infrastructure and task management features. Implemented worker pool manager for unsupervised sessions, manager daemon with auto-merge workflow, and delivered multiple task enhancements including manual dice control, reroll functionality, and queue redesign. Also resolved several bugs related to die display, session timezone handling, and task status management.

**Automation Infrastructure**
- Feat(automation): Add worker pool manager for fully unsupervised session
- Feat(automation): Add manager daemon and auto-merge workflow
- Feat(automation): Auto-unblock confused agent tasks
- Fix(automation): Correct architecture - Worker Pool Manager is opencode agent, not Python script
- Fix(automation): Support absolute worktree paths and add db export script
- Docs(automation): Add Worker Pool Manager prompt for opencode agent

**Task Management Features**
- Feat(TASK-FEAT-001): Add manual dice control
- Feat(TASK-FEAT-005): Add reroll functionality
- Feat(TASK-DB-004): create SQLite to PostgreSQL migration script
- Fix(tasks): Preserve in_review status when unclaiming tasks
- Test(worker): Add worker agent workflow tests

**UI Improvements**
- Feat(TASK-UI-001): Redesign queue screen to show all comics clearly
- Feat(TASK-FEAT-007): Improve session events display

**Bug Fixes**
- Feat(TASK-127): Fix Session Timezone Bug - Naive vs Aware Datetime Comparison
- Fix(TASK-127): manager review - simplify to use naive datetimes consistently
- Fix(TASK-127): session timezone bug - handle naive/aware datetime comparisons
- Feat(TASK-BUG-001): Fix Die Rolled Display Bug
- Fix(TASK-BUG-001): manager review fixes for linting and type errors
- Fix(TASK-BUG-001): Persist die rolled value when switching between roll and rate views
- Fix(TASK-BUG-002): fix incorrect die step messaging at d4/d20 boundaries

**Documentation & Prompts**
- Docs(manager): Add Manager-5 unsupervised session prompt
- Docs(MANAGER-4): Add continuous operation loop and retro
- Docs(worker-pool-manager): Add retro and update prompt with lessons learned
- Fix(retro): Update retro to reflect critical failure
- Fix(docs): Fix confusing bracket syntax in Worker Pool Manager prompt

**Architecture Cleanup**
- Remove InitializeTasksResponse schema - no longer needed after removing /initialize endpoint
- Remove TASK_DATA dict and /initialize endpoint - tasks now added via API

## Summary of Activity

1. Launched comprehensive automation infrastructure with worker pool manager for fully unsupervised development sessions and manager daemon with auto-merge workflow
2. Delivered task management enhancements including manual dice control, reroll functionality, and SQLite to PostgreSQL migration script
3. Redesigned queue screen for improved comic visibility and enhanced session events display
4. Resolved session timezone bug affecting naive/aware datetime comparisons throughout the application
5. Fixed die rolled display persistence issue and corrected die step messaging at d4/d20 boundaries
6. Implemented auto-unblock mechanism for confused agent tasks and added workflow testing
7. Created comprehensive documentation and prompts for Manager-5 unsupervised session and Worker Pool Manager
8. Cleaned up architecture by removing deprecated /initialize endpoint and TASK_DATA dictionary in favor of API-driven task creation
