## Summary of Activity

1. **Completed comprehensive dice mechanics overhaul** including white dice with black numbers for better contrast, full face numbers/pips for all die types, manual dice control functionality, and reroll capabilities with proper dice ladder integration

2. **Established production deployment infrastructure** with Docker configuration, Nginx reverse proxy, SSL support, and security documentation alongside SQLite to PostgreSQL migration script for database scalability

3. **Implemented task API initialization system** with 12 sample tasks (TASK-101 through TASK-112) and dedicated /api/tasks/initialize endpoint to support testing compliance and workflow automation

4. **Redesigned UI components** with queue screen showing all comics clearly, improved session events display, and new settings page, prioritizing mobile-first UX and touch-friendly interfaces

5. **Transitioned comic-web-scrapers to database-first architecture**, removing file fallbacks, refactoring report generation to use database storage, and adding vendor data to optimization results for persistent tracking

6. **Resolved integration testing challenges** by adding database overrides, fixing timezone issues in session tests, and implementing proper test database isolation to ensure reliable test execution

7. **Documented manager agent retrospectives** from Manager6 and Manager7 sessions, capturing workflow patterns, critical failures to avoid, and lessons learned for worker pool coordination
